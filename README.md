# -Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Predicting customer churn using machine learning. Includes EDA, data preprocessing, SMOTE+Tomek balancing, and model evaluation (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost). XGBoost selected as final model. Visualizations and presentation included.
This project aims to predict customer churn for a bank using demographic and financial data. We explore the dataset with EDA, handle class imbalance using SMOTE+Tomek, and evaluate multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The final model (XGBoost) achieves high accuracy with minimal overfitting.

üîç Key Features:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data preprocessing and balancing

Model comparison and evaluation

Insights for customer retention

üìÅ Includes code, visualizations, and a detailed presentation.
